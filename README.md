This repository contains raw data as well as supplemental material for the manuscript "Distorted estimates of implicit and explicit learning in applications of the process-dissociation procedure to the SRT task" by Christoph Stahl, Marius Barth, and Hilde Haider.

- **Raw data** for both the acquisition and generation tasks are available as CSV files in the folder "ESM".
- **Hierarchical analyses**: The folder also contains the file "hierarchical.pdf" that shows results of a hierarchical process-dissociation model.

## Abstract

> We investigated potential biases affecting the validity of the process-dissociation (PD)
  procedure when applied to sequence learning. Participants were or were not exposed to a
  serial reaction time task with two types of pseudo-random materials. Afterwards,
  participants worked on a free or cued generation task under inclusion and exclusion
  instructions. Results showed that pre-experimental response tendencies, non-associative
  learning of location frequencies, and the usage of cue locations introduced bias to PD
  estimates. These biases may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence of implicit
  and explicit knowledge. Potential remedies for these problems are discussed.
